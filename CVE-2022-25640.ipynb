    "\n",
    "In WolfSSL v5.2.0 the following vulnerability was fixed:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [High] A TLS v1.3 server who requires mutual authentication can be bypassed. If a malicious client **does not send the certificate_verify message** a client can connect **without presenting a certificate** even if the server requires one. Thank you to Aina Toky Rasoamanana and Olivier Levillain of Télécom SudParis. CVE-2022-25640\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This vulnerability affects mutual authentication, where a server expects the client to present a certificate signed by a CA the server trusts. From the description it seems like a pretty easy attack, because you just have to omit sending the certificate_verify  and the certificate message from the TLS 1.3 handshake.\n",

    "WolfSSL is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl). The following code compiles two versions (v5.1.1, and v5.2) statically, so that we can create a statically compiled TLS server for each library version later:\n",
